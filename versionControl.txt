Version control systems are a category of software tools that help a software team manage changes to source code over time. Version control software keeps track of every modification to the code in a special kind of database. If a mistake is made, developers can turn back the clock and compare earlier versions of the code to help fix the mistake while minimizing disruption to all team members.
The 3 main features:
1. Recording history
2. Collaboration
3. Branch features

Examples : Github, Beanstalk, PerForce, Apache Subversion etc.
