        HTML is the standard markup language for creating web pages. It allows the user to create and structure sections, paragraphs, headings, links, and blockquotes for web pages and applications. HTML is not a programming language, meaning it doesnâ€™t have the ability to create dynamic functionality. Instead, it makes it possible to organize and format documents, similarly to Microsoft Word.
        When working with HTML, we use simple code structures (tags and attributes) to mark up a website page. For example, we can create a paragraph by using p tag.
