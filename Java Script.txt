JavaScript is a scripting language used to create and control dynamic website content, i.e. anything that moves, refreshes, or otherwise changes on your screen without requiring you to manually reload a web page. Features like: animated graphics, photo slideshows, autocomplete text suggestions and interactive forms. JavaScript was created in the first place for DOM manipulation. Earlier websites were mostly static, after JS was created dynamic Web sites were made. Functions in JS are objects. They may have properties and methods just like another object. They can be passed as arguments in other functions. JS can handle date and time.Also, it performs Form Validation although the forms are created using HTML. HS doesn't need any compiler.
